I am a reseach computing support officer at the University of Sheffield, who has
just completed a PhD in numerical solar physics from the University of
Sheffield. Prior to starting my PhD I obtained a first class MPhys degree in
Physics with Planetary and Space Physics from The University of Wales
Aberystwyth, during which I spent 5 months studying at UNIS on Svalbard in the
high arctic.

My PhD studied the generation and propagation of magnetohydrodynamic waves from
the solar surface up into the million degree solar corona, via large-scale
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. It is thought these waves could help explain
why the upper layers of the solar atmosphere are hotter than expected.

I am the lead developer of the [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) project. Where I am
responsible for the SunPy Python package and the community around it. SunPy aims
to provide a free and open source package for the analysis of solar data using
the scientific Python ecosystem. To see more about SunPy visit its webpage
[www.sunpy.org](http://www.sunpy.org), and to see more of my contributions to
open source software see my [GitHub](https://github.com/Cadair) profile.
