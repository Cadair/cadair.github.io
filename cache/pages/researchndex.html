<p>My research interests are varied, while mostly focused around computing and
data processing. During my PhD I have focused on high-performance simulations
of the low solar atmosphere studing wave phenomena in magetic structures.
As well as this I have contributed to work on the automated detection and
tracking of 'Ellerman Bombs' which are small brigtening is the solar
chromosphere. I developed a algorithm to identify and track these brightnings
over time which allowed for the detailed statistical analysis of these events
to be performed.</p>

<h2>Simulations</h2>
<p><a id='simulations'></a>
My primary research interest is the simulation and analysis of wave propagation
in magnetic structures in the low solar atmosphere. This involves the use of
the &ldquo;Sheffield Advanced Code&rdquo; a versitale code base able to simulate
wave pertubations ontop of any background condition. The design of this code
allows for the study of comparitely small amplitude waves against the high
dynamic range of the solar atmosphere. Between the solar surface (the
photosphere) and the low solar corona the density of the plasma decreases by 8
orders of magntiude. Simulating wave phenomina in this kind of high gradient
atmosphere, under the infulence of gravity, is much easier with seperate
static background conditions.</p>
<p>My work has focused on the analysis of simulations of a single expanding flux
tube streaching from the photosphere. I developed a new analysis pipeline for
the fast and accurate decomposition of vector quanities in the simulations,
primarily velocity and wave energy flux, into components in the frame of the
magnetic field in three dimensions. To do this I utilised VTK, from Python, and
created a surface from magnetic field lines and used the normal vector from
this surface in additon to the magnetic field vector to compute the new
reference frame.</p>
<p>I have used this analysis method to study the effects of wave generation in
expanding flux tubes by a variety of different simulated drivers. The results
of this study indicated that a wider spctra of magnetohyrodynamic wave modes
are generated from broadband photospheric drivers than previously envvisaged.</p>
