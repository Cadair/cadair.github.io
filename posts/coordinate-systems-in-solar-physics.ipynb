    "Over the last few years, one of the places in SunPy I have been focusing my development efforts has been improving SunPy's coordinate handling. This has really taken two main tracks, the first is the better handling of FITS-WCS in SunPy Map, the second, and the topic of this post, is the representation of physical coordinates in SunPy.\n",
    "The full story of this post really starts before the 2013 Astropy coordination meeting, which I attended remotely. It was at this meeting I discussed with Erik Tollerud about the future redesign of Astropy's coordinates module and how we could leverage this for SunPy. Skip forward a fair amount and after all the planning and implementing of Astropy coordinates (which I was involved with), we set about implementing the solar physics coordinate systems in SunPy but as a 'plugin' to Astropy's module.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this I had the invaluble help of a Google Summer of Code student [Pritish Chakraborty](http://pritishc.com/) who did the vast majority of the implementation of what is now the `sunpy.coordinates` module. He and I embarked on a mission to learn not just the Astropy coordinates package which we were using, but also all the maths of these systems and the transformations between them, which will be the topic of this post.\n",

    "One common type of coordinate system in astronomy is the projected coordinate system. When observing the sky, the positions of objects on the sky can be described as points on a two dimensional spherical coordinate system, centred upon the observer. This also applies to imaging the sky, as most astronomers do regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other coordinate system a projected system has to have an origin, which is the observer, and it has to be aligned to some reference axes. In the case of the solar physics projected coordinate systems these reference axes are the line from the solar centre to the solar north pole, and the line from the solar centre to the observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two solar-specifc projected coordinate systems, helioprojective-cartesian and helioprojective-radial. The first, and most important thing to point out is that, despite the misleading names given to them, they are both fully sperical coordinate systems with positions given as longitude and latitude on the celestial sphere. They are so named, because of their similarities to the true 3D heliocentric coordinate systems we shall discuss later.\n"

This is possible due to the small angle approximation, which states that $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$ the error in these approximations is well below 1% for any point on the solar disk.\n",

Obviously, when converting from a projective (and two dimensional) point into a heliocentric (and three dimensional) system, an assumption has to be made to recover the third coordinate. This assumption is that the coordinate points lay on the surface of a sphere of fixed radius, normally taken to be the photospheric radius of the Sun. Using this assumption, the poisition in three dimensional space can be calculated. This step is performed automatically by the `sunpy.coordinates` module if the helioprojective frame is specified without a third coordinate."
