    "In this blog post I will demonstrate my git + LaTeX workflow for acedemic papers. For those of you who might be reading this lucky enough not to comprehend the workflow of submitting a paper to a scientific journal, it goes something like this (YMMV):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend months slaving over a manuscript you think is amazing.\n",
    "1. Get supervisors / co-authors feedback on your paper.\n",
    "1. Make lots and **lots** of corrections.\n",
    "1. Get supervisors / co-authors feedback on your paper.\n",
    "1. Send your paper to a journal.\n",
    "1. Get a referee report you try very hard not to to take personally.\n",
    "1. Make lots and **lots** of corrections.\n",
    "1. Resubmit your paper to the journal.\n",
    "1. Get a referee report you find slightly exasperating.\n",
    "1. Make even more corrections.\n",
    "1. Resubmit your paper to the journal.\n",
    "1. (Hopefully) Get your paper published.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole process, right at the heart of the scientific method, can be painful, demoralising and generally a lot of work, but it is all worth it when you get a paper with your name on it out into the world (*right?*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow involves integrating a lot of changes into your manuscript from a lot of different people who might be reading slightly different versions of the paper, while you might still be working on it in parallel. As well as this, most journals give you the option of providing the sources for your manuscript and only updating the parts that have changed during the resubmission process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation I have found myself in with all this, is that I need to be able to track changes to the paper that I have made, or I have had suggested to me, at different points in the cycle and I need to be able to highlight changes in the compiled output (generally referees and journals like versions with highlighted changes). The workflow I describe here assumes I am the only person involved in the process with the willingness to use a version control system, if you are lucky enough to have persuaded a co-author to join you in the future, then it is made a little easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to assume you have at least basic git knowledge (mainly, what a branch is and how to use one), if you need a primer on git, there are many great resources online."

This keeps git happy because it allows it to show you the difference between commits on a sentance by sentance basis rather than on a paragraph by paragraph basis.
