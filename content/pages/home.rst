I am a physicist studying for a PhD at Sheffield University in solar coronal
physics, having obtained a first class undergraduate MPhys degree in Physics
with Planetary and Space Physics at Aberystwyth University, including spending
the last 5 months of my studies at UNIS on Svalbard in the high arctic.

My PhD at Sheffield University is focusing on numerical simulations of the
lower solar atmosphere. The work I am doing is studying the propagation of
waves from the surface of the Sun up through the solar atmosphere, and the
amount of energy these wave carry. It is thought these waves could help explain
why the upper layers of the solar atmosphere is hotter than expected.

I am also a member of the SunPy community and a core developer of the SunPy
package. SunPy aims to provide a free and open source package for the analysis
of solar data, allowing high quality science to be done on open source and
freely available code. To see more about SunPy visit it's webpage
www.sunpy.org, and to see more of my contributions to open source software see
my GitHub page.
