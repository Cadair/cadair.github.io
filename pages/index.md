I am the Python developer for the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope Data Centre
and the lead developer of the SunPy project. I obtained a PhD in Numerical solar
physics from Sheffield University in 2016, prior to my PhD I obtained a first
class MPhys degree in Physics with Planetary and Space Physics from The
University of Wales Aberystwyth, during which I spent 5 months studying at UNIS
on Svalbard in the high arctic.

As the lead developer of the [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) project. I am responsible
for the SunPy Python package and the community around it. SunPy aims to provide
a free and open source package for the analysis of solar data using the
scientific Python ecosystem. To see more about SunPy visit its
webpage [www.sunpy.org](http://www.sunpy.org), and to see more of my
contributions to open source software see my [GitHub](https://github.com/Cadair)
profile.

As a member of the Python in Astronomy community I am involved in various
community driven projects such as [OpenAstronomy](http://openastromy.org) and
the [Python in Astronomy](http://openastronmy.org/pyastro) conference series. I
also run various training workshops for scientists, especially astronomers, to
teach better programming practices and Python for scientists.
