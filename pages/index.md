Stuart Mumford is a post-graduate researcher, working towards a PhD, at
The University of Sheffield. He obtained a first class MPhys degree in Physics
with Planetary and Space Physics from The University of Wales Aberystwyth,
during which he spent 5 months studying at UNIS on Svalbard in the high arctic.

Stuart's primary research interest is numerical simulations of the low solar
atmosphere, specifically the generation and propagation of MHD waves from the
solar surface up into the million degree solar corona. It is thought these
waves could help explain why the upper layers of the solar atmosphere are
hotter than expected.

Stuart is also heavily involved in the [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) project,
and is currently lead developer. SunPy aims to provide a free and open source
package for the analysis of solar data using the scientific Python ecosystem.
