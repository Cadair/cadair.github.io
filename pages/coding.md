Over the last few years I have been active in contributing to a few open
source projects, primarily written in Python. I am the lead developer and
executive director of the 'SunPy' project which is a core library for solar
physics data analysis.

##SunPy

The [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) project aims &ldquo;to facilitate and promote the
use and development of a community-led, free and open-source solar
data-analysis software based on the scientific Python environment.&rdquo;

##Astropy

Astropy is a core package for astronomy, it contains packages for coordinate
handling, world coordinate transforms and many many other goodies.
SunPy makes use of Astropy throughout the code, so I also contribute code back
to Astropy to make it better for all.

##yt

yt is an excellent Python package for the analysis and visualisation of
different simulation data. It's original focus was astrophysical simulations
which makes it very well suited to my MHD simulations. I have made some small
contributions to yt, as a thank you for making such a very useful package.

##Teaching Python

I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to teach a few different groups
of people Python. I designed and ran a "Python for Scientific Computing" 5 day
course for two groups at Armagh Observatory and then Queens University Belfast.
I have also lead Python tutorial sessions for The University of Sheffield's
MAS115 module as well as assisting in the R section of the course.
I was also invited to assist in teaching a 2 day [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
bootcamp at ESA's [ESAC](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC) where I wrote and
ran matplotlib and SunPy sessions.
